  abstract = {Since the Web 2.0 era, the Internet is a huge content editing place in which users contribute to the content they browse. Users do not just edit the content but they collaborate on this content. Such shared content can be edited by thousands of people. However, current consistency maintenance algorithms seem not to be adapted to massive collaborative updating. Shared data is usually fragmented into smaller atomic elements that can only be added or removed. Coarse-grained data leads to the possibility of conflicting updates while fine-grained data requires more metadata. In this paper we offer a solution for handling an adaptable granularity for shared data that overcomes the limitations of fixed-grained data approaches. Our approach defines data at a coarse granularity when it is created and refines its granularity only for facing possible conflicting updates on this data. We exhibit three implementations of our algorithm and compare their performances with other algorithms in various scenarios.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

  abstract = {Racket is a large language that is built mostly within itself. Unlike the usual approach taken by non-Lisp languages, the self-hosting of Racket is not a matter of bootstrapping one implementation through a previous implementation, but instead a matter of building a tower of languages and libraries via macros. The upper layers of the tower include a class system, a component system, pedagogic variants of Scheme, a statically typed dialect of Scheme, and more. The demands of this languageconstruction effort require a macro system that is substantially more expressive than previous macro systems. In particular, while conventional Scheme macro systems handle stand-alone syntactic forms adequately, they provide weak support for macros that share information or macros that use existing syntactic forms in new contexts. This paper describes and models features of the Racket macro system, including support for general compile-time bindings, sub-form expansion and analysis, and environment management. The presentation assumes a basic familiarity with Lisp-style macros, and it takes for granted the need for macros that respect lexical scope. The model, however, strips away the pattern and template system that is normally associated with Scheme macros, isolating a core that is simpler, can support pattern and template forms themselves as macros, and generalizes naturally to Racket’s other extensions.},

  abstract = {Mutual exclusion locks remain the               de facto               mechanism for concurrency control on shared-memory data structures. However, their apparent simplicity is deceptive: It is hard to design scalable locking strategies because locks can harbor problems such as priority inversion, deadlock, and convoying. Furthermore, scalable lock-based systems are not readily composable when building compound operations. In looking for solutions to these problems, interest has developed in               nonblocking               systems which have promised scalability and robustness by eschewing mutual exclusion while still ensuring safety. However, existing techniques for building nonblocking systems are rarely suitable for practical use, imposing substantial storage overheads, serializing nonconflicting operations, or requiring instructions not readily available on today's CPUs.                                         In this article we present three APIs which make it easier to develop nonblocking implementations of arbitrary data structures. The first API is a               multiword compare-and-swap               operation (MCAS) which atomically updates a set of memory locations. This can be used to advance a data structure from one consistent state to another. The second API is a               word-based software transactional memory               (WSTM) which can allow sequential code to be reused more directly than with MCAS and which provides better scalability when locations are being read rather than being updated. The third API is an               object-based software transactional memory               (OSTM). OSTM allows a simpler implementation than WSTM, but at the cost of reengineering the code to use OSTM objects.                          We present practical implementations of all three of these APIs, built from operations available across all of today's major CPU families. We illustrate the use of these APIs by using them to build highly concurrent skip lists and red-black trees. We compare the performance of the resulting implementations against one another and against high-performance lock-based systems. These results demonstrate that it is possible to build useful nonblocking data structures with performance comparable to, or better than, sophisticated lock-based designs.},

This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

The last 8 years have seen an exciting new development: variance reduction (VR) for stochastic optimization methods. These VR methods excel in settings where more than one pass through the training data is allowed, achieving a faster convergence than SGD in theory as well as practice. These speedups underline the surge of interest in VR methods and the fast-growing body of work on this topic. This review covers the key principles and main developments behind VR methods for optimization with finite data sets and is aimed at non-expert readers. We focus mainly on the convex setting, and leave pointers to readers interested in extensions for minimizing non-convex functions.},

  author = {Gustafson, John L and Yonemoto, Isaac},
  abstract = {A new data type called a posit is designed as a direct drop-in replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floating-point numbers (floats). Unlike earlier forms of universal number (unum) arithmetic, posits do not require interval arithmetic or variable size operands; like floats, they round if an answer is inexact. However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including larger dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure, bitwise identical results across systems, simpler hardware, and simpler exception handling. Posits never overflow to infinity or underflow to zero, and “Nota-Number” (NaN) indicates an action instead of a bit pattern. A posit processing unit takes less circuitry than an IEEE float FPU. With lower power use and smaller silicon footprint, the posit operations per second (POPS) supported by a chip can be significantly higher than the FLOPS using similar hardware resources. GPU accelerators and Deep Learning processors, in particular, can do more per watt and per dollar with posits, yet deliver superior answer quality. A comprehensive series of benchmarks compares floats and posits for decimals of accuracy produced for a set precision. Low precision posits provide a better solution than “approximate computing” methods that try to tolerate decreased answer quality. High precision posits provide more correct decimals than floats of the same size; in some cases, a 32-bit posit may safely replace a 64-bit float. In other words, posits beat floats at their own game.},

Hardware designers have come up with ever more sophisticated memory handling and acceleration techniques–such as CPU caches–but these cannot work optimally without some help from the programmer. Unfortunately, neither the structure nor the cost of using the memory subsystem of a computer or the caches on CPUs is well understood by most programmers. This paper explains the structure of memory subsystems in use on modern commodity hardware, illustrating why CPU caches were developed, how they work, and what programs should do to achieve optimal performance by utilizing them.},

  abstract = {Clojure was designed to be a general-purpose, practical functional language, suitable for use by professionals wherever its host language, e.g., Java, would be. Initially designed in 2005 and released in 2007, Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, but is not a direct descendant of any prior Lisp. It complements programming with pure functions of immutable data with concurrency-safe state management constructs that support writing correct multithreaded programs without the complexity of mutex locks.             Clojure is intentionally hosted, in that it compiles to and runs on the runtime of another language, such as the JVM. This is more than an implementation strategy; numerous features ensure that programs written in Clojure can leverage and interoperate with the libraries of the host language directly and efficiently.             In spite of combining two (at the time) rather unpopular ideas, functional programming and Lisp, Clojure has since seen adoption in industries as diverse as finance, climate science, retail, databases, analytics, publishing, healthcare, advertising and genomics, and by consultancies and startups worldwide, much to the career-altering surprise of its author.             Most of the ideas in Clojure were not novel, but their combination puts Clojure in a unique spot in language design (functional, hosted, Lisp). This paper recounts the motivation behind the initial development of Clojure and the rationale for various design decisions and language constructs. It then covers its evolution subsequent to release and adoption.},

It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title Meditations is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection.

One approach to this task is to screen the evidence using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) to make presumptive identifications. This manuscript introduces a new library-search algorithm that enhances presumptive identifications of mixture components using a series of in-source collision-induced dissociation mass spectra collected through DART-MS. The multistage search, titled the Inverted Library-Search Algorithm (ILSA), identifies potential components in a mixture by first searching the lowest fragmentation mass spectrum for target peaks, assuming these peaks are protonated molecules, and then scoring each target peak with possible library matches. As a proof of concept, the ILSA is demonstrated through several example searches of model seized drug mixtures of acetyl fentanyl, benzyl fentanyl, amphetamine, and methamphetamine searched against a small library of select compounds and the freely available NIST DART-MS Forensics Database. Discussion of the search results and several open areas of research to further extend the method are provided. This new approach for presumptive identification provides analysts with refined information about mixture components and will be of immediate importance in forensic analysis using DART-MS. A prototype implementation of the ILSA is available at https://github.com/asm3-nist/DART-MS-DST.},

The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract = {"Developers rightly fear the unintended complexity that infects most code. This book shows you how to write software that keeps complexity close to its inherent minimum. As you write software you should distinguish between code that alters your system's state, and code that does not. Once you learn to make that distinction, you can refactor much of your state-altering "actions" into stateless "calculations." Your software will be simpler. The book also teaches you to solve the complex timing bugs that inevitably creep into asynchronous and multithreaded code. In advanced seections of the book you learn how composable abstractions help avoid repeating code and open up new levels of expressivity"--Back cover},

  abstract = {Much of the power of the UNIX operating system comes from a style of program design that makes programs easy to use and, more important, easy to combine with other programs. This style has been called the use of software tools, and depends more on how the programs fit into the programming environment ߞ how they can be used with other programs ߞ than on how they are designed internally. But as the system has become commercially successful and has spread widely, this style has often been compromised, to the detriment of all users. Old programs have become encrusted with dubious features. Newer programs are not always written with attention to proper separation of function and design for interconnection. This paper discusses the elements of program design, showing by example good and bad design, and indicates some possible trends for the future.},

In the study reported here, we assessed the relationship between classroom performance and actual Internet usage for academic and nonacademic purposes. Students who were enrolled in an introductory psychology course logged into a proxy server that monitored their online activity during class. Past research relied on self-report, but the current methodology objectively measured time, frequency, and browsing history of participants’ Internet usage. In addition, we assessed whether intelligence, motivation, and interest in course material could account for the relationship between Internet use and performance. Our results showed that nonacademic Internet use was common among students who brought laptops to class and was inversely related to class performance. This relationship was upheld after we accounted for motivation, interest, and intelligence. Class-related Internet use was not associated with a benefit to classroom performance.},

So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. Professor and TED presenter Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective, from our tendency to divide the world into two camps (usually some version of us and them) to the way we consume media (where fear rules) to how we perceive progress (believing that most things are getting worse). Our problem is that we don't know what we don't know, and even our guesses are informed by unconscious and predictable biases. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. That doesn't mean there aren't real concerns. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most."-- Provided by publisher},

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

  abstract = {OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as "post-OT" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and often portrayed OT as an incorrect and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors; OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. These discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between OT and CRDT in the real world. We report these results in a series of three articles. In this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between OT and CRDT in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. Moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative CRDT solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of OT and CRDT. We hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.},

  abstract = {People of all ages are more likely to choose to restudy items (or allocate more study time to items) that are perceived as more difficult to learn than as less difficult to learn. Existing models of self-regulated study adequately account for this inverse relation between perceived difficulty of learning and these 2 measures of self-regulated study (item selection and self-paced study). However, these models cannot account for positive relations between perceived difficulty of learning and item selection, which are demonstrated in the present investigation. Namely, in Experiments 1 and 2, the authors described conditions in which people more often selected to study items judged as less difficult than as more difficult to learn. This positive relation was not demonstrated for self-paced study, which was always negatively correlated with judged difficulty to learn. In Experiments 3 through 6, the authors explored explanations for this dissociation between item selection and self-paced study. Discussion focuses on a general model of self-regulated study that includes planning, discrepancy reduction, and working-memory constraints.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Peer-to-peer systems provide scalable content distribution for cheap and resist to censorship attempts. However, P2P networks mainly distribute immutable content and provide poor support for highly dynamic content such as produced by collaborative systems. A new class of algorithms called CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type), which ensures consistency of highly dynamic content on P2P networks, is emerging. However, if existing CRDT algorithms support the “edit anywhere, anytime” feature, they do not support the “undo anywhere, anytime” feature. In this paper, we present the Logoot-Undo CRDT algorithm, which integrates the “undo anywhere, anytime” feature. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with related algorithms and measure the impact of the undo feature on the global performance of the algorithm. We prove that the cost of the undo feature remains low on a corpus of data extracted from Wikipedia.},
